In the new study, scientists tried to pin down the date for the most recent common ancestor of modern birds. Other studies have suggested a vast range of dates, from 72 million to 170 million years ago.
"Modern birds are the most diverse group of terrestrial vertebrates in terms of species richness and global distribution, but we still don't fully understand their large-scale evolutionary history," study co-researcher Joel Cracraft, a curator in the Department of Ornithology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. (There are more than 10,000 living species of birds, compared to about 5,000 living species of mammals.)
"It's a difficult problem to solve because we have very large gaps in the fossil record," Cracraft added. "This is the first quantitative analysis estimating where birds might have arisen, based on the best phylogenetic [family tree] hypothesis that we have today."
Birds began their evolutionary split from dinosaurs about 150 million years ago, during the Jurassic period. But these early birds had some retro features: Like dinosaurs, they still had teeth; some with claws on the end of each digit; and they had long, bony tails (today's birds usually don't have long tails, and those that do sport tails have ones mostly made of feathers, not bone), said Daniel Ksepka, a curator of science at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich, Connecticut, who was not involved in the study.
